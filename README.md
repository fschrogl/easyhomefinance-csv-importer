# EasyHomeFinance Importer

I used to use [Spendria](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketapp101.finance) to keep track of
my daily expenses and switched recently to [Easy Home Finance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vopo.easyhomefinance).
The later one features an option for importing and exporting its SQLite database schema. Hence this importer tries
to transform CSV files exported from Spendria into a Easy Home Finance compatible SQLite database. If everything works
out I should be able to take my existing expense records with me.
