# EasyHomeFinance Importer

I used to use XLS files and later [Spendria](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketapp101.finance) to
keep track of my daily expenses. Recently I switched to [Easy Home Finance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vopo.easyhomefinance).
EHF features an option for importing and exporting its SQLite database schema. Hence this importer tries
to transform my XLS files and CSV files exported from Spendria into a Easy Home Finance compatible SQLite database.

If everything works out I should be able to take my existing expense records with me.
